This is the first software I wrote!

Gently I leave, just as I gently came; I gently wave goodbye to the clouds in the western sky.

The golden willows by the riverside are brides in the setting sun; their reflections in the shimmering waves ripple in my heart.

The green algae on the soft mud sway gracefully under the water; in the gentle waves of the Cambridge river, I am willing to be a water plant.

The pool under the elm's shade is not a spring, but a rainbow from the sky, shattered among the floating duckweed, settling into a rainbow-like dream.

Seeking a dream? Punt a long pole, and drift towards greener grass; with a boat full of starlight, singing amidst the splendor of stars.

But I cannot sing aloud, silence is the flute of farewell; even the summer insects are silent for me, silence is tonight's Cambridge!

Quietly I leave, just as I quietly came; I wave my sleeve, without taking away a single cloud.
