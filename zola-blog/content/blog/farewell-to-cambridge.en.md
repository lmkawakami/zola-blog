Gently I leave, just as I gently came; I gently wave goodbye to the clouds in the western sky.

> Gently I leave,<br>
> Just as I gently came;<br>
> I gently wave,<br>
> Bidding farewell to the clouds in the western sky.<br>
> <br>
> The golden willows by the riverside,<br>
> Are brides in the setting sun;<br>
> Their reflections in the shimmering waves,<br>
> Ripple in my heart.<br>
> <br>
> The green algae on the soft mud,<br>
> Sway gracefully under the water;<br>
> In the gentle waves of the Cambridge river,<br>
> I am willing to be a water plant.<br>
> <br>
> The pool under the elm's shade,<br>
> Is not a spring, but a rainbow from the sky,<br>
> Shattered among the floating duckweed,<br>
> Settling into a rainbow-like dream.<br>
> <br>
> Seeking a dream? Punt a long pole,<br>
> And drift towards greener grass;<br>
> With a boat full of starlight,<br>
> Singing amidst the splendor of stars.<br>
> <br>
> But I cannot sing aloud,<br>
> Silence is the flute of farewell;<br>
> Even the summer insects are silent for me,<br>
> Silence is tonight's Cambridge!<br>
> <br>
> Quietly I leave,<br>
> Just as I quietly came;<br>
> I wave my sleeve,<br>
> Without taking away a single cloud.
